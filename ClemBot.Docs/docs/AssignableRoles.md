# Assignable Roles

## Overview

Servers often have many roles that regular users can have, but might not want to give all users access to all roles; however, it can be annoying to manually give people the roles they want. 
ClemBot provides a way to mark roles as assignable so that normal users can add and remove them as they please with a simple command.

## Commands

### Roles
Shows all currently assignable roles in the server, or adds an assignable role to yourself if one is specified.

#### Aliases
* `role`

#### Format
```txt title="List all assignable roles in the server"
!roles
```

```txt title="Assign a given role to yourself"
!roles <rolename>
```
#### Example

```
!role
```

```
!role myrolename

!role @myrole
````
