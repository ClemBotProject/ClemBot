# Designated Channels

## Overview
ClemBot provides multiple different logging solutions for all aspects of your server. 
The way that ClemBot allows you to configure this is through a concept called **Designated Channels**. 
There are multiple possible designations for different events that ClemBot processes. 
You may add these designations to as many channels within your server as you would like. 
A channel can also have multiple designations at once.

## Available Designations

| Name           | Description                                                                           |

| moderation_log | Channel for ClemBot to send a log of all moderation actions that happen in the server |
| starboard      | Channel to allow for starred messages to be immortalized for eternity                 |
