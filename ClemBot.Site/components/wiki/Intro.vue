          Hello there and welcome to ClemBot! ClemBot is a modular and
          configurable Discord bot for all of your server needs. For a complete
          list of all ClemBot commands run the <b>!help</b> command in a server
          that ClemBot is in.

          After ClemBot has been added to your server and initialized, it's time
          to do some basic setup. The first thing to do is decide which command
          prefix you would like ClemBot to respond to. By default ClemBot will
          respond to "!" as well as ClemBot's mention. To change this, simply
          run the prefix command with the new prefix you would like ClemBot to
          respond to. If you are fine with "!" remaining the prefix, you may
          skip this step.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="has-background-grey-darker">!prefix ?</blockquote>
        <p>or</p>
        <blockquote class="has-background-grey-darker">
          @ClemBot prefix ?
        </blockquote>
        <p>Congratulations, you've set up ClemBot to respond in your server!</p>

        <p>
          The next step is to assign claims to your moderator/admin roles,
          Claims are ClemBot's way of granting access to different ClemBot
          functionality. Claims are associated with roles and can be added and
          removed from them arbitrarily. Please see the claims section of this
          Wiki for more information.
