          Hello there and welcome to ClemBot! A modular and configurable Discord
          bot for all of your server needs. For a complete list of all ClemBot
          commands run the <b>!help</b> command in a server that ClemBot is in.

          After ClemBot has been added to your server and initialized its time
          to do some basic setup. First thing to do is decide on what command
          prefix you would like the bot to respond to. By default ClemBot will
          respond to "!" as well as the bots mention. To change this, simply run
          the prefix command with the new prefix you would like the bot to
          respond too. If you are fine with "!" remaining the prefix you may
          skip this step.
        </p>
        <h4 class="title is-light">Example</h4>
        <blockquote class="has-background-grey-darker">!prefix ?</blockquote>
        <p>or</p>
        <blockquote class="has-background-grey-darker">
          @ClemBot prefix ?
        </blockquote>
        <p>Congratulations, you've set up ClemBot to respond in your server!</p>

          The next step is to assign claims to your moderator/admin roles,
          Claims are ClemBots way of granting access to different ClemBot
          functionality. Claims are associated with roles and can be added and
          removed from them arbitrarily. Please see the claims section of this
          wiki for more information.

          ClemBot is super configurable so feel free to read the next sections
          of this wiki and play around with what it can do!
