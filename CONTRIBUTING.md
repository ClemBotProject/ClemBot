============================
This is a guide on how to develop and contribute to this project

## Dependencies
Make sure you can run these commands and install them if not present.
### ClemBot.Bot
* Python 3.10 [Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
* pip3 (packaged as python3-pip) 
* A python IDE/Text Editor: Anything will work but people generally use Visual Studio Code [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Jetbrains Pycharm [Link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

### ClemBot.Api
* .Net 6 SDK [Link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
* A C# IDE, Preferably [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Windows only) or [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (Cross Platform, Free with a student email)

### ClemBot.Site
* nvm [Link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
* yarn [Link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) (Find your operating system in the dropdown)

### Database
* PostgresSQL 14 [Link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* PgAdmin4 [Link](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

## Get a Discord bot token and enable intents
* Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications (log in if needed)
* Create an application (name doesn't matter)
* Click "Bot" it the left sidebar
* Create a bot
  * The bot's name will be what users see in servers
  * Changing the bot's name changes the BotToken
* Make note of the token on this page (later refered to as BotToken)
* Enable Discord member intents ![Intents](https://i.postimg.cc/hhWy9N7W/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-10-30-25-AM.png)


## Join the test server
[Click here to join the server](https://discord.gg/FACu8k4)
ping @Jayy#6249 for permissions to add bots

## Prepare bot for connecting to discord server
* Click "OAuth2" in the left sidebar
* In the "scopes" section, check `bot`
* In the "bot permissions" section, check the following boxes [![perms](https://i.postimg.cc/NFkdvDCY/perms.png)](https://postimg.cc/xNqvKvSF)
* Copy the link from the "scopes" section and open in a new tab/window
* Select the test server to add the bot to

## Prepare the Repo
* Fork this repo
* `git clone` your fork to wherever you want to work on this bot

## Prepare your ClemBot.Api config variables
ClemBot.Api uses `dotnet user-secrets` [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0) to securely store sensitive values like db connection strings and api keys

* After you have started up and configured PostgresSQL with your desired username and password you need to set the Connection string for ClemBot.Api
* `cd` into ClemBot/ClemBot.Api/ClemBot.Api.Core
* Run `dotnet user-secrets set "ClemBotConnectionString" "YourConnectionString"` (Example:  "Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Database=clembotdb;User Id=XXXXX;Password=XXXXX;")
* Generate a `BotApiKey` with this website [Link](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx)
* Run `dotnet user-secrets set "BotApiKey" "KeyYouGeneratedAbove"`

## Prepare your ClemBot.Bot config variables
* Copy `BotSecrets.json.template` and rename that copy to `BotSecrets.json`
* Copy/paste the token from the Discord page into the `BotToken` empty string
* Make the `ApiUrl` row `https://localhost:5001/`
* Copy and paste the ClemBot.Api key value that you generated above into the `ApiKey` row
* Copy and paste the channel Ids of the channels in the test server that you want to use for Connection Status updates and Error Logging into the `ErrorLogChannelIds` and `StartupLogChannelIds`. If you dont want this. Leave the field as an empty brackets, []
* Set a custom bot prefix in the `BotPrefix` field that will invoke your commands 

### All Config Variables

* `BotToken`:(Required) Your discord bots api access token
* `ApiUrl`:(Required) Url of the ClemBot.Api ASP.Net endpoints (defaults to `http://localhost:5001/`)
* `ApiKey`:(Required) Access key for the bot endpoints in ClemBot.Api
* `ClientToken`:(Optional) Used for the Website Frontend, can be ignored if you are not working on that
* `ClientSecret`:(Optional) Used for the Website Frontend, can be ignored if you are not working on that
* `BotPrefix`:(Required) Your discord bots prefix that it will default to responding too
* `SiteUrl`: (Optional) The url of your local site or hosted instance for bot links to the site
* `StartupLogChannelIds`:(Optional) The Id of the channel for the bot to send startup events too
* `ErrorLogChannelIds`:(Optional) The Id of the channel for the bot to send error events too (recommended if you are doing work with services
* `GifMeToken`:(Optional) GifMe api token
* `ReplUrl`:(Optional) The url of the Snekbox container that allows for sandboxed evals
* `GitHubSourceUrl`:(Optional) Url that the !source command uses to link source code
* `MerriamKey`:(Optional) Merriam api token
* `WeatherKey`:(Optional) Weather forecast api token
* `GeocodeKey`:(Optional) Geocode weather service api token
* `AzureTranslateKey`:(Optional) Azure translation api token
* `BotOnly`: (optional) If set to true, puts ClemBot.Bot into Bot only mode which deactivates the api and allows for limited functionality. Mainly used when a feature only requires discord and needs no persistence/database
* `MessageApiBatchSize` (Optional: Defaults to 5) Sets the max cache size for clembots internal message catch before it is flushed to the api

## Setting up the ClemBot.Bot build environment
Installing Poetry:  
`pip3 install poetry` windows: `py -m pip install poetry`

Tell Poetry to put the venv in the project folder
`poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`

Installing dependencies with Poetry:
`poetry install`

You can then test-run the bot with the command:  
`poetry run python3 -m bot`  windows: `poetry run py -m bot`
when you are in the directory `ClemBot/ClemBot.Bot`

The bot should show up in the test server and respond to commands (test with `<your_prefix>hello`)

## Setting up the ClemBot.Api build environment

* Open the `ClemBot.Api.sln` file in the `ClemBot/ClemBot.Api` folder to open the project in either Visual Studio or Rider
* Click the run button in your preferred IDE

## Setting up the ClemBot.Site build environment

* Navigate to the ClemBot.Site folder in your shell
* Install Node.js 16 with nvm with the command `nvm install 16` then `nvm use 16`
* Install dependencies with yarn with the command `yarn install`
* The dev server can then be run with the command `yarn run dev` 

## Final Notes
ClemBot is composed of several seperate components that all talk to each other over HTTP to form a complete system. Depending on what you are developing you might not need all of them setup to develop what you want. 

Here are some common scenarios and what pieces you need to have running:

1. Developing a simple Discord command that does not require the database
  - You just need to run the ClemBot.Bot project with the BotOnly config flag set to true
2. Developing functionality that does require the database and the api
  - You will need to have the postgres server running, the ClemBot.Api project running and ClemBot.Bot running
3. Developing or fixing a visual bug on the website that is not in the dashboard
  - You will need just the ClemBot.Site codebase running to work on this
4. Developing a dashboard page or fixing dashboard functionality
  - You will need the complete ClemBot system running, the Bot, the Api, the Site and the database
