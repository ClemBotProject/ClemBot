# Architecture overview

The bot is set up in a simple way. There are 3 layers, the Cog layer, the Service layer and the Data layer.

1. Cog layer - This is where the frontend bot command code resides. Anything that you directly use to interface with discord goes in this layer.
2. Service layer - This is where all things that are bot related but not controlled through front end commands live. Things like user tracking, event handling etc all go in here.
3. Data layer - This is the abstraction on top of the sqlite database. This layer is a collection of repositories which contain the code to query and insert from the DB.

The bot loads Cogs and Services dynamically. To create a new command simply create a class that inherits from Command.Cog and defines a setup function in module scope at the bottom. See [example_cog.py](https://github.com/ClemsonCPSC-Discord/ClemBot/blob/master/bot/cogs/example_cog.py) for an example. 

The bot does the same thing for services, to see how to define a service, see [example_service.py](https://github.com/ClemsonCPSC-Discord/ClemBot/blob/master/bot/services/example_service.py)
